/** 
 * 1. A total of 8 data types where 7 primitives and 1 object type.
 *    - [Primitive Types] They can only store a single data, and have no methods.
 *    - [Primitive Types] string, number, bigint, boolean, undefine, symbol and null.
 *    - Differently from the primitives, Objects can store collections of data, their properties.
 *    - Primitive Types are immutable and Object Types are mutable.
 * 2. typeof operator can be used to check a data type of variable/expression. 
 * 3. The typeof operator returns a string value starting with lowercase.
 * 4. A data be represented in three forms: Literals, variables and expression.
 * 5. Following 6 values will be considered falsy in a boolean context false, undefined, null 0, NaN and empty string.
 *    - null: value represents the intentional absence of any object value. 
 * 6. parseInt(), parseFloat(), .toString() method can be used to convert datatyoe.
 * 7. Be familiar with these notations: {}, [], /abc/, ""
 * 8. All primitive data types are imutable.
 * 9. Why do you need to stick with let or const?
 *     - Beacuse let and const support block scoping.
 * 10. Except for `undefined` and `null`, every other 5 primitives have wrapper object types (starts with uppercase).
