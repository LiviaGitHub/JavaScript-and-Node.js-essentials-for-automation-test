/** 
 * Syntax in JavaScript refers to the set of rules that govern the structure and format of the code. 
 * It defines how statements, expressions, and other elements of the language should be written and organized to produce valid and executable code.
 * For example, in JavaScript, syntax rules specify that statements should end with a semicolon ;, 
 * that variable names should start with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $, 
 * and that comments are written using the // or /* ... 
 */

// Here's an example of a simple JavaScript statement that follows the syntax rules:

let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);

// In this example, the statement let message = "Hello, World!"; declares a variable message and assigns it a string value. 
// The statement console.log(message); logs the value of message to the console. 
// Both statements follow the syntax rules for statements in JavaScript and are valid and executable.
