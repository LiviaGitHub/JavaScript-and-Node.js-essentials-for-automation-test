// Here's an example of how to use a while loop in JavaScript:

let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

// In this example, we use a while loop to log the values of i to the console, from 0 to 4.
// The syntax of the while loop is as follows:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

// The condition is a boolean expression that is checked before each iteration of the loop. 
// If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.
// In this example, the condition is i < 5. The loop will continue as long as i is less than 5. 
// The i++ statement at the end of the loop increments the value of i by 1 in each iteration, 
// until it reaches 5 and the loop terminates.
