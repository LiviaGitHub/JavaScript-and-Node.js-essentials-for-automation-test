// example of a function in JavaScript that does an action:
function showAlert() {
    alert("Hello, world!");
  }

// This function is called "showAlert" 
// and it uses the built-in alert() function to display a message box with the text "Hello, world!" when it's executed.
// To call this function, you would simply use its name followed by parentheses, like this:

showMessage(); // Calling the function to display the message box
// This would trigger the function to execute and display the message box.
